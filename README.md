This Python script implements a simple to-do list manager through a command-line interface.

Users can interactively add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as done, or exit the program. Upon execution, the program presents users with a menu of options, including adding a task, displaying all tasks, marking a task as done, or exiting the program. Each task is represented as a dictionary with keys for the task description and its completion status.

Functions:
    main(): The main function that controls the flow of execution, presenting the menu and executing the selected option.
